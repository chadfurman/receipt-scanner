# Receipt Scanner

Using Google Vision API, process some images into a CSV for use in cataloging your grocery purchases

## Requirements

Note some of the dependencies require python development libraries and C++, in Fedora you can install these as follows (note the # implies root prompt or sudo):

```
# dnf install libjpeg-dev gcc-c++ kernel-devel python3-devel
```

Then install the Python package dependencies with the following command (note the $ implies "user prompt" rather than root or sudo)
```
$ pip3 install . 
```
